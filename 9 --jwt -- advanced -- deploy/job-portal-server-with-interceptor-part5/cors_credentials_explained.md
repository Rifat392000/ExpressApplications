# Understanding CORS Credentials Option

## What is `credentials: true`?

The `credentials: true` option in CORS configuration allows the browser to include credentials (like cookies, authorization headers, or TLS client certificates) in cross-origin requests.

When you set `credentials: true`, it tells the server to respond with the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` header, which signals to browsers that they should send cookies and other authentication data when making requests to this API from different origins.

## When is this important?

This configuration is crucial when:

1. Your frontend and backend are on different domains
2. You need to maintain authenticated sessions across those domains
3. You're using cookies for authentication, session management, or storing user preferences

## What happens without it?

Without `credentials: true`, browsers would block cookies from being sent in cross-origin requests, which would break authentication flows where a user logs in on your frontend and then needs to make authenticated API calls to your backend.

## Important security consideration

Keep in mind that when using `credentials: true`, you must specify explicit origins in your `origin` setting (as you're doing with `allowedOrigins`). The wildcard `'*'` won't work with credentials for security reasons.

```javascript
app.use(cors({
    origin: allowedOrigins,  // Must be specific origins, not '*'
    credentials: true
}));
```
